This project is a portfolio website which includes a home page, portfoio page, and contact page to make a three page web responisve, mobile first website.

On the home page there is basic personal information next to an image, in total equalling a short biography.

On the portfolio page previous works are showcased through images and brief descriptions.

On the contact page visitors to the site are able to share name, email, and a brief message to reach out.

HTML and CSS were used to try and create a responsive, mobile first or mobile friendly site, meaning that it
looks good on any size screen. It is hopefully SEO friendly and will be rated well by google in terms of usability.
Included are columns rows, containers, and made possible through learning and implementing bootstrap templates in a meaningful way to fulfill project requirements.

All links should be working and layout attempts to follow examples set in project outline
where deviations are stylistic.

This page was created with the help of instructors (thank you Ben and Justin), many collaborative zoom sessions with classmates
partilcularly James R, Michael, Melissa, Gabriel H. It was a challenge and I hope to keep learning how to code smarter not longer!
